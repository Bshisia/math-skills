# Math Skills

The purpose of this project is for you to calculate the following:

    Average
    Median
    Variance
    Standard Deviation

The program reads from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned above. In other words, the program must be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument. The data in the file will be presented as the following example:

 189
 113
 121
 114
 145
 110
 ...

This data represents a statistical population: each line contains one value.

## Features

- go files
    - consists of the functions that are to be carried out that is Average, Median, Variance and standard deviation 
- go test files
    - this are unit tests for very function
- lisence
    - consists of the MIT lisence that renders my project open source
